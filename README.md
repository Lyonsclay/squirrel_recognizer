This project is initially based on an awesome workshop from Nodevember 2017 by (Eve Porcello)[https://github.com/eveporcello/nodevember/tree/master/graphql-service].

Using graphql-express we spin up a grapiql server:)

# Instructions to Setup
```git clone https://github.com/Lyonsclay/squirrel_recognizer```
```yarn```
```yarn start```
  * Visit localhost:4000/graphiql

Try building your own schema and resolvers with this as reference.
