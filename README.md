This project is initially based on an awesome workshop from Nodevember 2017 by (Eve Porcello)[https://github.com/eveporcello/nodevember/tree/master/graphql-service].

Using (apollo-server-express)[https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-express] we spin up a (grapiql)[https://github.com/graphql/graphiql] server:)

# Instructions to Setup
```git clone https://github.com/Lyonsclay/squirrel_recognizer```
```yarn```
```yarn start```
  * Visit localhost:4000/graphiql

Try building your own schema and resolvers with this as reference.
